        <p> My name is Rana Jugal. <br> I am from surat.  <br> I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard
            to introduce yourself
            because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with.<br> Let me give a try to see
            what kind of
            image you have about me through my self-description. <br>
           <b> <em> I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</em>  </b> </p>
